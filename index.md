Over the years, I have built my skill set in software programs including R, Stata, SAS and Latex through school coursework and other online platforms. I have taken the opportunity to learn Python, Maple and Julia as well. Apart from software packages, I have also worked towards building my skills in research, research writing and working with different economic models at both micro and macro level.
